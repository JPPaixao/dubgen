# *dubgen*
### Sampler and MIDI Arrangement Generator

*dubgen* creates monophonic samples from given sounds, modifies MIDI compositions, and then choses a sequence of samples to generate an arrangement (new MIDI + samples).

Created samples can also be modulated by a Synthesizer.

**How it works**
1. **Samples**: In the *".../dubgen/user/test_sounds/"* folder, add sounds to create a library of samples. We strongly recommend inserting more than 20 sounds.

2. **MIDI**: In the *".../dubgen/user/midi/"* folder, insert three MIDI files, one for each instrument (Only ONE file per folder).

3. (Optional) You can train your own "Instrument Classification Model". For this, add sounds in each Instrument Category Folder in *".../dubgen/user/train_sounds/"*. We recommend inserting more than 20 sounds per Instrument.
